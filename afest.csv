16630,"Werewolves of the Dark Ages",08/11/2016,19:00,01:00,"Werewolf (the genre) is a social game ideally played by large groups of people. It is originally based on a game known as Mafia. In this game, the Villagers must discover the identity of the Werewolves before they are all killed. Every night, the Werewolves form a hunting pack to kill a single unlucky victim. When the sun rises, the hysterical Villagers pick someone to lynch. During the daytime phase of the game, the Werewolves pretend to be Villagers, or can even pretend to be the Seer, the one special Villager who can identify the Werewolves at night. Players are allowed to and encouraged to bluff, lie, and misdirect in order to win the game.  If the Villagers lynch all of the Werewolves, they win the game. If the number of Werewolves becomes equal to or greater than the number of all other remaining villagers, the Werewolves overpower them and win the game.  This is a custom version that includes a wide range of special roles beyond just the Seer. There are over 30 different roles to pick from. The suggested minimum number of players is 10, including the Town Mayor (GM), but it can go up to 30 people in one game.","G1","",

All that remains of the tribe are its four goblin 'heroes'—Reta Bigbad the fighter, Chuffy Lickwound the rogue, Poog the cleric of Zarongel, and Mogmurch the alchemist. Homeless and bored, they left their swampy homeland to join the neighboring goblin tribe, the Birdcrunchers. The good news is that the Birdcrunchers are willing to let the goblin heroes join their tribe. The better news is that the Birdcrunchers have heard of these four, and want one of them to become their new chieftain. The bad news is that before the goblins can join, they'll need to endure a series of dangerous and humiliating tests. Very dangerous. Very humiliating. The worse news is that lately Birdcruncher chieftains have had really short lifespans—they're being killed by the pet fire-breathing boar of a local ogre who wants the Birdcruncher land as his own. Can the four heroes of the now-dead Licktoad tribe save the Birdcrunchers and, in so doing, become their new leaders? (Pregen level 3)","G6F","",

These characters are the great saviors of their civilizations. Before they came into existence, the humans were plagued by monsters like chimeras that took away their lands and forced them to live in walled-off cities. When the Phoenixborns came, they fought off the chimeras and freed the lands for humans to take over once again.    But the time of peace was short-lived. A prophecy arose that if one Phoenixborn was able to absorb enough Ashes of others, they would ascend into full gods and take mastery over this world. This, as well as humans' greed for land, fueled the War of Ashes. The great cities now fight among each other, each one of them with a Phoenixborn at its helm, and you will decide who will rise and who will fall to ashes.","BG1","",

When the sun rises, the hysterical Villagers pick someone to lynch.

Players are allowed to and encouraged to bluff, lie, and misdirect in order to win the game.  If the Villagers lynch all of the Werewolves, they win the game. If the number of Werewolves becomes equal to or greater than the number of all other remaining villagers, the Werewolves overpower them and win the game.  This is a custom version that includes a wide range of special roles beyond just the Seer. There are over 30 different roles to pick from. The suggested minimum number of players is 10, including the Town Mayor (GM), but it can go up to 30 people in one game.","G1","",
